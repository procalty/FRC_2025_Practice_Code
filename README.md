Hello, if you are here I have no idea as to why you are here. 
This code is my practice code for FRC. This pretty much makes a fictional robot with a massive nerf gun turret strapped on top
I don't have a proper design of this robot, so if you would like to make one please do.
I am not following the FRC 2025 Rulebook, as I don't have a proper design of a robot. 
In theory I can steal a design from somewhere but I am a very lazy person and I don't feel ready yet so...
Uhhhhh I hope you like the code? I don't know why you need this but okay.
